## Overview
The ShoppingCart project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing products in a shopping cart environment. It includes both backend and frontend components, allowing for a full-stack implementation.

## Backend
The backend is structured to handle the core logic of the shopping cart. The `src` folder contains the `product.py` file, which defines the `Product` class with properties such as `product_id`, `name`, `price`, and `quantity`. The `main` folder is reserved for the main application logic, while the `assets` folder is intended for static resources.

## Frontend
The frontend folder is designated for the user interface and client-side logic, which will be developed to interact with the backend services.

## GitHub Workflows
The `.github/workflows` folder is set up for continuous integration and deployment workflows, ensuring that the project can be easily maintained and updated.

## Getting Started
To get started with the ShoppingCart project, clone the repository and navigate to the appropriate folders for backend or frontend development. Further instructions will be provided in the respective README files.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please follow the standard guidelines for contributing to open-source projects.
