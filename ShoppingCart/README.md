## Getting Started
To get started with the ShoppingCart project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. You can then explore the backend and frontend components.

## Backend
The backend is structured to include a source folder for the main application logic and a separate folder for static assets. The `product.py` file defines the `Product` class, which includes properties such as `product_id`, `name`, `price`, and `quantity`.

## Frontend
The frontend folder is intended for the application code that will interact with users and display products.
